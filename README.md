Web based file manager system for personal use(?)

This is intended to become an easy to use web GUI allowing the owner to upload files and organize them in a PC-esque file manager. Ideally this will be expanded to include password protection, so that the files stored are not publically available. Stretch goals include allowing owners to share files or folders with other individuals using a one-time link, and allowing multiple users to have "accounts" on the site (multiple owners.)
