        Computer science at AlgomaU since May 2018<br>
        Expected graduation April 2021<br>
        I think I'm functionally a third year currently, though it is my second
        year of school.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Recently interested in competitive programming.<br>
        Competed with an AlgomaU team in the 2018 North Central North America
        region.<br>
        Our team answered 3/10 questions, and I'm hoping to do better next year!
        <br>

        <br>
        I used to play a lot of WoW so you may know me as Isaem from my time
        playing, <br>
        however, I've quit due to school and various projects.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm currently playing violin with the Sault Symphony, which keeps me
        <br>
        busy whenever I'm not working on projects for school or studying.
